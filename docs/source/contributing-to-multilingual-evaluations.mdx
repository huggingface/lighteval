# Contributing to multilingual evaluations

## Contributing a small translation

We define 19 `literals`, basic keywords or punctuation signs used when creating evaluation prompts in an automatic manner, such as `yes`, `no`, `because`, etc.

We welcome translations in your language!

To contribute, you'll need to
1. Open the [translation_literals](https://github.com/huggingface/lighteval/blob/main/src/lighteval/tasks/templates/utils/translation_literals.py) file
2. Edit the file to add or expand the literal for your language of interest. 

```python
    Language.ENGLISH: TranslationLiterals(
        language=Language.ENGLISH,
        question_word="question", # Usage: "Question: How are you?"
        answer="answer", # Usage: "Answer: I am fine"
        confirmation_word="right", # Usage: "He is smart, right?"
        yes="yes", # Usage: "Yes, he is"
        no="no", # Usage: "No, he is not"
        also="also", # Usage: "Also, she is smart."
        cause_word="because", # Usage: "She is smart, because she is tall"
        effect_word="therefore", # Usage: "He is tall therefore he is smart"
        or_word="or", # Usage: "He is tall or small"
        true="true", # Usage: "He is smart, true, false or neither?"
        false="false", # Usage: "He is smart, true, false or neither?"
        neither="neither", # Usage: "He is smart, true, false or neither?"
        # Punctuation and spacing: only adjust if your language uses something different than in English
        full_stop=".",
        comma=",",
        question_mark="?",
        exclamation_mark="!",
        word_space=" ",
        sentence_space=" ",
        colon=":",
        # The first characters of your alphabet used in enumerations, if different from English
        indices=["A", "B", "C", ...]
    )
```

## Contributing a new multilingual task

You should first read our guide on [adding a custom task](adding-a-custom-task), to better understand the different parameters we use. 

Then, you should take a look at the current [multilingual tasks](https://github.com/huggingface/lighteval/blob/main/src/lighteval/tasks/multilingual/tasks.py) file, to understand how they are defined. For multilingual evaluations the `prompt_function` should be implemented by language-adapted template. The template will take care of correct formatting, correct and consistent usage of language adjusted prompt anchors (e.g Question/Answer) and punctuation.

Browse the list of all templates [here](https://github.com/huggingface/lighteval/tree/main/src/lighteval/tasks/templates) to see which are the most adapted to your own task.

Then, when ready, to define your own task, you should:
1. create a Python file as indicated in the above guide
2. import the relevant templates for your task type (XNLI, Copa, Multiple choice, Question Answering, etc)
3. define one or a list of tasks for each relevant language and evaluation formulation (for multichoice) using our parametrizable [`~tasks.lighteval_task.LightevalTaskConfig`] class

```python
your_tasks = [
    LightevalTaskConfig(
        # Name of your evaluation
        name=f"evalname_{language.value}_{formulation.name.lower()}",
        # The evaluation is community contributed 
        suite=["community"],
        # This will automatically get the correct metrics for your chosen formulation
        metric=get_metrics_for_formulation(
            formulation,
            [
                loglikelihood_acc_metric(normalization=None),
                loglikelihood_acc_metric(normalization=LogProbTokenNorm()),
                loglikelihood_acc_metric(normalization=LogProbCharNorm()),
            ],
        ),
        # In this function, you choose which template to follow and for which language and formulation
        prompt_function=get_template_prompt_function(
            language=language,
            # then use the adapter to define the mapping between the 
            # keys of the template (left), and the keys of your dataset
            # (right)
            # To know which template keys are required and available,
            # consult the appropriate adapter type and doc-string.
            adapter=lambda line: {
                "key": line["relevant_key"],
                ...
            },
            formulation=formulation,
        ),
        # You can also add specific filters to remove irrelevant samples 
        hf_filter=lambda line: line["label"] in <condition>,
        # You then select your huggingface dataset as well as 
        # the splits available for evaluation
        hf_repo=<dataset>,
        hf_subset=<subset>,
        evaluation_splits=["train"],
        hf_avail_splits=["train"],
    )
    for language in [
        Language.YOUR_LANGUAGE, ...
    ]
    for formulation in [MCFFormulation(), CFFormulation(), HybridFormulation()]
]
```
4. then, you can go back to the guide to test if your task is correctly implemented!

> [!TIP]
> All [`~tasks.lighteval_task.LightevalTaskConfig`] parameters are strongly typed, including the inputs to the template function. Make sure to take advantage of your IDE's functionality to make it easier to correctly fill these parameters.


Once everything is good, open a PR, and we'll be happy to review it!
