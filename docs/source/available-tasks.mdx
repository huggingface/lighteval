# Available Tasks

## Discovering Available Tasks

### List All Tasks

You can get a list of all available tasks by running:

```bash
lighteval tasks list
```

This command will display all tasks organized by their suites (e.g., leaderboard, lighteval, community).

### Inspect Specific Tasks

You can inspect a specific task to see its configuration, metrics, and requirements by running:

```bash
lighteval tasks inspect <task_name>
```

For example:
```bash
lighteval tasks inspect "leaderboard|truthfulqa:mc|0"
```
