abstract:
PROST is a benchmark for testing physical reasoning about objects through space
and time. It includes 18,736 multiple-choice questions covering 10 core physics
concepts, designed to probe models in zero-shot settings. Results show that even
large pretrained models struggle with physical reasoning and are sensitive to
question phrasing, underscoring their limited real-world understanding.
