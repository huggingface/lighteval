"""
abstract:
ARC-AGI tasks are a series of three to five input and output tasks followed by a
final task with only the input listed. Each task tests the utilization of a
specific learned skill based on a minimal number of cognitive priors.
In their native form, tasks are a JSON lists of integers. These JSON can also be
represented visually as a grid of colors using an ARC-AGI task viewer. You can
view an example of a task here.
A successful submission is a pixel-perfect description (color and position) of
the final task's output.
100% of tasks in the ARC-AGI-2 dataset were solved by a minimim of 2 people in
less than or equal to 2 attempts (many were solved more). ARC-AGI-2 is more
difficult for AI.
