abstract:
Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset,
consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles,
where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the
corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.

SQuAD 2.0 combines the 100,000 questions in SQuAD1.1 with over 50,000
unanswerable questions written adversarially by crowdworkers to look similar to
answerable ones. To do well on SQuAD2.0, systems must not only answer questions
when possible, but also determine when no answer is supported by the paragraph
and abstain from answering.
