abstract:
GPQA is a dataset of 448 expert-written multiple-choice questions in biology,
physics, and chemistry, designed to test graduate-level reasoning. The questions
are extremely difficultâ€”PhD-level experts score about 65%, skilled non-experts
34% (even with web access), and GPT-4 around 39%. GPQA aims to support research
on scalable oversight, helping humans evaluate and trust AI systems that may
exceed human expertise.
